# ProjetoRAS
This group project in the context of Software Requirements and Architec-
tures class was involved developing an online test application, structured
into distinct phases. Firstly, a comprehensive requirements gathering
process was undertaken to ascertain the projectâ€™s scope and objectives.
Subsequently, the architecture, leveraging microservices, and API were
meticulously defined to ensure scalability and flexibility. Finally, the im-
plementation phase translated these plans into a functional application,
focusing on seamless user experience and robust backend functionality.
